        /// Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For example: 
        /// 
        /// `application/zip`

        /// GitHub expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example,
        /// you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.
        /// 
        /// When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted.

        /// **Notes:**
        /// *   GitHub renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The "[List assets for a release](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#list-assets-for-a-release)"
